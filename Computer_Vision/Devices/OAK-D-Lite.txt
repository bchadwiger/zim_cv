====== Notes ======

(from [[#ref_learn_opencv]])
OAK-D and OAK-D-Lite are Spatial AI Cameras. At a high-level OAK-D and OAK-D-Lite consist of the following important components:

* A 4K RGB Camera : The RGB camera placed at the center can capture very high-resolution 4k footage. Typically, this camera is used for visual perception.
	A Stereo pair : This is a system of two cameras (the word “stereo” means two) used for depth perception.
	Intel® Myriad™ X Visual Processing Unit (VPU) : This is the “brain” of the OAKs. It is a powerful processor capable of running modern neural networks for visual perception, and simultaneously creating a depth map from the stereo pair of images in real time.
